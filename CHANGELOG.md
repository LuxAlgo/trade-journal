# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Chart indicators in Pine Script, run by PineTS in a Web Worker: 15 built-ins (moving averages, VWAP, Bollinger, Donchian, Supertrend, ATR, RSI, MACD, Stochastic, ADX, OBV and signal scripts), a Pine editor with errors and line numbers, a "My indicators" library, settings and visibility saved with each analysis, and indicator `alert()` messages in chart alerts. Adds AGPL-3.0 dependencies (`pinets`, `@luxalgo/vela-pinets`) with reviewed license-gate exceptions
- Charts: a live Vela chart for any symbol from your market-data source (latest candles on open, automatic updates, older history on scroll back), stylus drawing (pen, highlighter, hardware eraser, palm rejection), automatic saving per symbol, drawing layers grouped in folders, line-crossing alerts, and journal embeds that reopen the chart
- Customizable dashboard: drag cards to rearrange, hide and restore them, save named layouts; responsive layout with a mobile navigation drawer
- Privacy mode that masks monetary values across the app while keeping counts, ratios and chart shapes
- Markdown notes with formatting toolbar, reusable templates, exact trade links, and image/PDF attachments on trades, days and notebook notes
- Advanced report filters, comparison groups, a two-way cross-analysis matrix, and additional breakdowns (asset class, month, entry/exit hour, position size, planned/realized R)
- Playbook rule checklists per trade with adherence rates and followed-vs-broken performance
- Routines with weekday schedules and completion history; a missed-opportunity log kept out of trading metrics
- PDF and PNG review exports; JSON export now includes folders, templates, rule assessments, routines and defaults
- Configurable breakeven tolerance, default fees, and default stop/target distances per account and symbol
- Importers: MetaTrader 5 deal reports and TradingView strategy exports
- Realized R accounts for contract multipliers and scaled entries
- Optional historical market data connections (London Strategic Edge, Alpaca, OANDA, Binance, Coinbase, or your own candle CSV) with estimated MAE/MFE and candle replay on closed trades
- Prop firm tracker: evaluation and reset costs, refunds, payout requests, receipts, cash ROI, renewals, attachments, CSV import and export
- Calendar insights, rolling performance trends, and a trade explorer scatter in Reports
- Light mode, a collapsible sidebar, and friendlier AI setup and error notices

### Changed

- Vela upgraded to 0.7.7 (required by its Pine add-on)
- Data loads render as React transitions, so a tab change paints progressively instead of freezing while every card and chart mounts at once
- The development server runs on Turbopack, roughly halving first-visit compile times when switching tabs in `pnpm dev`
- Removed the gradient accent bar and gradient Edge Score number; the active nav item and the score now use the solid brand blue
- Trade pages chart recorded fills only and never contact a data provider on open; market candles load only from a data source you choose
- Gross profit and gross loss now include every closed trade, so trades labeled breakeven by a tolerance still count; the Edge Score version is bumped to 2
- Reports and dashboard aggregation reuse daily totals and equity for large histories; charts load only the components they use
- Executions are validated and written together with their recomputed trades in one transaction
- Node 22 or newer is required (already required by the AI dependencies)

### Fixed

- Chart pattern tools: the Elliott impulse is placed on six points (0-1-2-3-4-5, five waves) and the correction on four (0-A-B-C, three waves), instead of Vela's five and three points; the Shark harmonic is labelled 0-X-A-B-C. Wave drawings made with the old point count keep their points and labels
- Password protection now verifies the session signature on every API route. Previously, when `JOURNAL_PASSWORD` was set, any request carrying a cookie of the right name was accepted, so a forged cookie could read the journal.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-03

Initial public release.

### Added

- Round-trip engine: flat-to-flat position cycles from raw fills, FIFO/LIFO/weighted-average matching, partial fills, position flips, futures multipliers, rebuild-stable annotation keys (`@luxalgo/journal-core`)
- Analytics: P&L, win and day-win rates, profit factor, expectancy, R multiples, streaks, drawdown and recovery, profit concentration, calendar and bucket aggregations, the open Edge Score
- Statement importers with auto-detection for 12 formats, one-click TradeZella/Tradervue migration with exact P&L reconciliation, and a column mapper for anything else (`@luxalgo/journal-importers`)
- Web app: dashboard, P&L calendar, daily journal with voice dictation, trades table, trade pages with charting, notebook, playbooks, reports
- Broker sync via `@luxalgo/broker-sdk` with credentials encrypted at rest
- Optional AI reflection (bring your own Anthropic API key): session recaps, trade critiques, ask-your-journal
- Docker deployment, optional password auth, full JSON/CSV export
